How to run: 
 - Download the repository
 - Navigate to the tabs-example directory
 - Run `npm install` to install dependencies
 - Run `npm run build` to build the extension locally
 - Navigate to your extension manager in Chrome and load the unpacked extension in by selecting the tabs-example directory
 - Use!

How to use:
 - exTimesion begins to track any tabs that are opened and then visited
 - Tab Open Time displays the amount of time since the tab has simply been opened and alive on your browser
 - Tab Focus Time displays the amount of time the tab has been looked at (i.e. how much time you've actually spent on that tab)
 - Both last across sessions so I can go back in between other applications (i.e. I write an essay on Word and revisit Chrome) and still see my tab times tracked after they are retrieved from the Chrome cache
 - `Group Active tabs` button groups all current active tabs into a tab group
